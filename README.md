YELP Dataset insights

To run the code as a docker container - 
open a docker console locally and type in the command- 

docker run sanketshinde/yelp-prediction

This will produce several lines of output.

Running the code locally will also open two files Restaurant_Rating_star.svg and User_Preference.svg n the browser.
These files show a radar chart that shows the distribution of subtopic ratings for restaurants and preference distribution for users
respectively.

Note: Running the docker container will not show the visualization in browser. Refer to the presentation for verifying the results.
Download the model related files from the shared folder on google drive
